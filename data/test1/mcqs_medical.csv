Elderly patients should be aware of the risk of iatrogenic side effects, particularly from psychotropic drugs. Polymedication exposes patients to the risk of drug interactions.

For mood disorders, risk factors are more marked in the elderly: non-psychiatric co-morbidities, loss of autonomy, and stressful psycho-social events. Progress depends in part on the therapeutic strategy. The risk of suicide is high, and the number of completed suicides is higher than in younger patients.

There is a frequent association with non-psychiatric pathologies, either by increasing the risk of developing a depressive episode characterized by certain pathologies (dementia, cardiovascular pathologies, sensory impairment, cancer) or by the fact that a depressive episode increases the risk of occurrence or aggravation of certain non-psychiatric pathologies (cognitive impairment, or even progression to Alzheimer's disease or related illnesses, diabetes, coronary artery disease).

Serotonergic antidepressants are the first-line treatment. For bipolar disorder, thymoregulators are the mainstay of treatment.

For psychotic disorders, second-generation antipsychotics should be used as first-line treatment. Treatment is identical to that for adults.

For Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), management must be comprehensive, with priority given to non-drug approaches. A non-psychiatric, iatrogenic, or psychiatric cause must be ruled out. Drug strategies are reserved for severe BPSD.

== Main Psychotherapeutic Trends ==  
There are many different types of psychotherapy. Some of the main trends include:

- **Supportive Psychotherapy:** Widely used and involves adapting the processes of the helping relationship, such as empathic listening and a supportive framework, to psychotherapy.

- **Cognitive Behavioural Therapies (CBT):** Comprises three waves (behavioural, cognitive, ""emotional""). It originates from the work of Ivan Pavlov on conditioning and Aaron Beck on cognitivism. It postulates that patients' symptoms stem from inappropriate learned behaviour, dysfunctional cognition, and/or difficulties in emotional regulation. CBT aims to identify these behaviours, thoughts, and emotions and to find alternative adaptive strategies.

- **Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy:** Includes both analytically inspired psychotherapy and traditional psychoanalysis, stemming from the work of Sigmund Freud. It postulates that patients' problems are based on unresolved unconscious conflicts from childhood.

- **Family/Systemic Therapies:** Consider the family or couple as a dynamic system with continuous interaction among members. The patient's symptoms (""designated patient"", ""symptom carrier"") are included in this systemic dynamic, which needs rebalancing by re-establishing more functional communication and/or interrelationships.

- **Therapeutic Education:** Aims to help patients acquire or maintain the skills they need to manage their lives as well as possible with a chronic disease. It includes organized activities designed to make patients aware of and informed about their illness and care.

- **Cognitive Remediation:** An approach based on neurology, neuropsychology, and rehabilitation, enabling patients to improve their cognitive functioning and thus their quality of life.",0.5,13.09,False,True,0.7192832827568054,0.0,b,False,5,2,73,356

**Theoretical Principles:**

- **Three Waves:**
  - **Behavioural (1st half 20th century):** Classical and operant conditioning; inappropriate learned behaviour.
  - **Cognitive (>1960):** Dysfunctional cognitive patterns give rise to behaviours.
  - **Emotional (>2000):** Emotional regulation enables cognition to be understood and behaviour to be modified, based on acceptance and mindfulness.

**Practical Details:**

- **Functional Analysis:** Study of the problem.
- **Therapeutic Objective**
- **Assessment of Effectiveness**
- **Therapeutic Contract**

- **Behavioural Method:**
  - Desensitisation: ""In sensu"" exposure (in the imagination).
  - Graduated ""in vivo"" exposure to the anxiogenic stimulus (in reality).
  - Immersion (flooding): Direct, ungraded exposure.

- **Cognitive Method:**
  - Study and modify erroneous thought patterns.
  - Self-affirmation.
  - Social skills.

- **Emotional Method:**
  - Emotional regulation techniques (mindfulness, etc.).
  - Observation and acceptance of emotions.
  - Commitment in line with its values.

**Primary Prevention**

In France, the Veil law of 1976, the Evin law of 1991, and the Bertrand decree of 2006 have curbed the expansion of smoking.

- The main measures recommended are:
  - A ban on all direct and indirect advertising.
  - Repeated and dissuasive price increases for all tobacco products.
  - Protection against exposure to passive smoking in public places and workplaces.
  - Education and information, including health warnings in the form of images on packets.

The 2014-2019 National Tobacco Reduction Programme (PNRT) included three major measures:

1. Introduction of plain packaging.
2. Reimbursement of nicotine substitutes or varenicline by the French health insurance system.
3. Introduction of a ""No Smoking Month"" every November.

The 2018-2022 National Programme for Tobacco Control includes regional variations:

1. Protecting children and preventing them from taking up smoking.
2. Encouraging and supporting smokers to quit.
3. Acting on the tobacco economy to protect public health.
4. Monitoring, evaluating, researching, and disseminating knowledge about tobacco.

Its ambition is that, by 2032, children born since 2014 will become the first generation of non-smoking adults (<5% smokers).

**Secondary Prevention**

All healthcare professionals should be involved in smoking prevention from school age and in helping people to stop smoking.

The factors most predictive of smoking cessation are:

- Good socio-economic level.
- Low tobacco consumption.
- No one around them smokes.
- Low alcohol consumption.
- Late onset of intoxication.
- Short duration of intoxication.
- Long delay between awakening and first cigarette.

== Definitions/Population Concerned ==  
All children with a serious life-threatening illness, whether life-limiting (no hope of cure, usual early death) or life-threatening (curative treatment possible but high risk of premature death).

Six groups were identified according to life-threatening or life-limiting pathology, including:

- Group 5: Newborns with very limited life expectancy.  
- Palliative care does not stop when the child dies. It includes support for the family's bereavement:  
- Group 6: Members of a family who have lost a child unexpectedly as a result of illness, a situation caused by an external cause or a loss during the perinatal period, e.g., trauma, stillbirths, abortions.

== Integrated, Non-Sequential Approach ==  
Early palliative care may be concomitant with any curative care. In all cases, it involves active management. It is the intensity and objective of the treatments that are discussed.

== Graduated Organisation ==  
For complex situations, frontline teams can call on regional pediatric palliative care resource teams (ERRSPP) or pediatric EMSP mobile palliative care teams, including at home.

**Antenatal**  

- Extreme prematurity at the limits of viability: high risk of mortality and morbidity, particularly neurological.  
  - <22SA and/or <500g: fetus (antenatal) / newborn (after birth) said to be non-viable.  
  - <24SA: Most French teams do not resuscitate.  
  - Between 24 and 26 weeks' gestation: on a case-by-case basis.  
  - The parents' wishes, informed of the severity of the prognosis, are an important factor in the decision.  

- Incurable and particularly serious genetic diseases and malformations.  
  - After antenatal diagnosis, if the parents wish to continue the pregnancy and do not request a medical termination of pregnancy (IMG). Uncertainty is often at its greatest. There is the possibility of fetal death in utero, death at birth, or a life of unpredictable duration, very short or prolonged over months or years with a severe disability. Thinking about all these possibilities at the same time: psychological violence for the parents.  
  - Information for parents, diagnostic reassessment at birth.  
  - When in doubt, intensive management of organ failure will be initiated. In some cases, resuscitation on standby and urgent collegial consultation are necessary.  

**Post-natal**  

- Neonatal resuscitation situations with therapeutic impasse or diagnosis of particularly serious neurological lesions (extreme prematurity or severe perinatal anoxia). The question arises of a decision to limit or stop treatment by collegial procedure in accordance with the Clayes-Leonetti law.  

== Palliative Care in the Delivery Room ==  
However short it may be, it is a time for living and not a time for waiting for death. Draw on the concepts developed by developmental care. Parents will be involved according to their wishes.

- Hetero-evaluation via the NFCS Neonatal Face Coding System, EDIN scales (Newborn Pain and Discomfort Scale).  
- Analgesic and/or sedative treatments in the event of symptoms: sucrose (sugar solution), morphine, midazolam (usually oral).

== In the Event of Death ==  
- Respect and propose rituals and memorial traces.

### Knowing Water-borne Parasites

- **Amoebiasis**

- **Giardiasis**

### Etiologies

#### Amoebiasis

Amoebiasis is a protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is cosmopolitan but predominates in areas with poor hygiene. It is transmitted by ingestion of water or food contaminated with cysts, which are highly resistant in the external environment. Once ingested, the cysts give rise to amoebiasis infestation (vegetative forms) and/or amoebiasis disease with intestinal +/- hepatic tropism, through invasion of tissues by vegetative forms of *Entamoeba histolytica histolytica*.

#### Cryptosporidiosis

Cryptosporidiosis is a protozoonosis, transmitted by faeco-oral or manuported transmission, which is also cosmopolitan. Clinical signs include acute choleriform or chronic diarrhea and malabsorption in immunocompromised patients.

#### Giardiasis

Giardiasis is a cosmopolitan protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is transmitted via the faeco-oral route or during sexual relations between men. Transmission occurs through ingestion of cysts, which transform into vegetative forms in the intestinal lumen. Clinical symptoms are often asymptomatic, but chronic diarrhea may be present in children, leading to malabsorption syndrome or malnutrition in low-resource countries.

#### Toxoplasmosis

Toxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis. The causative agent is a protozoan whose definitive host is the cat (the only host that excretes oocysts), with humans and other mammals as intermediate hosts. Humans ingest oocysts via food or water contaminated with cat feces and can also become infected by ingesting cysts present in the meat of other intermediate hosts infested with cysts. The clinical course of primary infection is symptomatic in only 20% of cases and is aspecific (fever, polyadenopathy, odynophagia, etc.). Severity is linked to immunodepression (primary infection or reactivation) or in congenital forms.",1.0,8.89777777777778,False,True,0.6954023838043213,0.5466286341349283,b,False,2,3,179,780

**Toxoplasmosis**  
Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease transmitted by drinking water.

**Taeniasis**  
Taeniasis is a cestodosis, cosmopolitan for ""Taenia saginata"" and tropical for ""Taenia solium."" These flatworms release rings containing eggs in patients' feces. Humans become infected by ingesting eggs (fecal-oral transmission) or larvae contained in undercooked or uncooked meat from intermediate hosts (beef for ""T. saginata"" and pork for ""T. solium""). Ingestion of T. solium eggs leads to cysticercosis, which involves the migration of cysticerci into tissues, with the neurological form being serious. Ingestion of larvae leads to adult tapeworms in the digestive tract.

**Trichinellosis**  
Trichinellosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis, and humans are accidental hosts. Infection occurs by eating raw or undercooked meat contaminated with encysted larvae. Once ingested, the larvae travel to the striated muscles. Clinical symptoms typically include febrile polymyositis and facial edema. The course can be serious, even fatal, in the early phase of larval dissemination.

**Anisakidosis**  
Anisakiasis is a zoonosis of the cold seas. Humans are accidental hosts, contracting the disease by ingesting raw, marinated, or undercooked fish infested with larvae. Symptoms are digestive, with gastralgia, nausea, and vomiting soon after the infested meal. Intestinal or generalized allergic reactions are sometimes observed, including anaphylactic shock.",1.0,9.081818181818182,False,True,0.7416962385177612,0.5923922061920166,a,False,5,4,179,781

- **Thermal Pollution:** Linked to various human activities, it poses a health risk through the microbiological proliferation it causes, such as free amoebae, legionella, and algae.

- **Radioactive Pollution:** Generally low, except in cases of exceptional accidents.

- **Chemical Pollution:** Probably the most common form:
  - Sodium from mining waste or seawater infiltration.
  - Nitrates from agricultural activities, which are toxic if reduced to nitrites that bind to haemoglobin. They are precursors of nitrosamines and can be carcinogenic.
  - Phosphates from agricultural activities and urban waste contribute to the eutrophication process, leading to the development of algae that produce toxins.
  - Heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium) are deposited in river and coastal sediments. They can concentrate in aquatic flora and fauna, posing a poisoning risk to humans.
  - Dangers associated with mineral salt imbalances due to natural contamination or disruption caused by man-made additions.
  - Organic pollution linked to human activities, including detergents, solvents, hydrocarbons, and medicines.

- **Microbial and Parasitic Pollution:**
  - Originates from fecal, human, and animal sources linked to inadequate treatment of drinking water. The most well-known and frequent are responsible for gastrointestinal disorders.
  - **Bacteria:** Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae.
  - **Viruses:** Enterovirus, Coxsackie, Echovirus, Hepatitis A and E, Coronavirus, Rotavirus, Norovirus, etc., causing gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and neuromeningeal disorders.
  - **Parasites:** Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium spp.
  - In certain uses of water, microorganisms can become pathogenic, such as Legionella pneumophila and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (Mycobacterium xenopi).

The first steps to prepare for the investigation of a CFTI are as follows:

- Notify the doctor in charge or the hospital's operational hygiene team (if a healthcare establishment).
- Identify patients who have or had clinical signs.
- For each patient, document a list of symptoms, the date and time of their onset, and a list of meals eaten over the last three days.
- Keep leftovers of raw materials and food served to the community over the last three days (keep refrigerated, not frozen).
- Take stool samples and possibly vomit samples from patients.
- Prepare a list of meal menus for the last three days.
- Report any suspected CFTI to the ARS medical inspector or, if unavailable, to the veterinary food hygiene service.

**Investigation by ARS Medical Inspectors**

1. **Epidemiological Survey**  
   - Calculation of attack rates and distribution of cases as a function of time and space.
   - Verification of hypotheses through investigation.
   - For communities with fewer than 30 exposed people, a cohort study is conducted. For communities with more than 30, a case-control study is performed.

2. **Microbiological Investigation**  
   - Samples are taken from the presumed source (communities must keep a control meal from the previous three days) for microbiological and toxicological analysis.
   - Sampling of pathological products from affected patients (stools, vomit, blood, etc.).

3. **Health Survey**  
   - Evaluation of production, transport, and storage of raw materials.
   - Assessment of food preparation, transport, and maintenance of the cold chain.
   - Inspection of the sanitary condition of food preparation and storage premises.

**Title:** Main Pathophysiological Mechanisms Responsible for CVI  
**Description:** Principles of Venous Return Physiology and Dysfunctions Leading to Varicose Veins and CVI  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology

Arterial circulation is driven by the contraction of the heart's ventricles, propelling blood into the arteries. Venous return is facilitated by a combination of suction and propulsion forces, aided by centripetal and unidirectional venous valves that act as anti-reflux devices. The cooperation of these mechanisms means that any malfunction can lead to venous return anomalies, clinically expressed as chronic venous insufficiency and the dilation of superficial veins, known as varicose veins.

== Deep Venous Network, Superficial Venous Network ==  
There are two venous networks in the lower limbs:

- The deep venous network: Drains 90% of venous blood.
- The superficial venous network (primarily the greater saphenous vein and lesser saphenous vein): Handles the remaining 10% of venous blood.
- These networks, separated by the superficial muscular aponeuroses, are connected by perforating veins.

These data are categorized in the CEAP classification (""A"" for anatomy):

- **S**: Superficial
- **D**: Deep
- **P**: Perforating

== Venous Reflux or Venous Obstruction ==  
Venous insufficiency is linked to either venous reflux or venous obstruction, often following deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. These mechanisms may occur in isolation or conjunction. The pathophysiological mechanisms (""P"" for pathophysiology) are included in the CEAP classification:

- **R**: Reflux
- **O**: Obstruction

== Venous Return ==  
Venous return from the lower limbs occurs against orthostatic pressure due to gravity. The factors influencing venous return include:

- Left ventricular perfusion pressure (residual capillary pressure is higher than diastolic pressure)
- Atrial depression and diaphragmatic movements, which draw venous blood into the right atrium
- The veno-muscular pump of the lower limbs

Deep vein thrombosis can lead to post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). There are two main possible mechanisms: valve destruction, which causes reflux, and/or residual venous obstruction. This results in signs of venous insufficiency, which may even lead to venous claudication.

The severity of PTS depends on the extent of venous dysfunction resulting from the sequelae of post-thrombotic syndrome (valvular destruction, residual venous obstruction, and venous reflux). Its severity is assessed using the Villalta score, which is based on subjective and objective clinical signs of venous insufficiency.

**Title:** Knowing the Aetiologies of Varicose Veins and CVI  
**Description:** Understanding the Main Causes of CVI  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) results from the inability of the venous network to ensure correct drainage of the lower limb. Any phenomenon that reduces this will generate venous stasis, which is the cause of CVI. There are three main causes of venous return failure. The possible aetiologies are included in the CEAP classification of CVI (""E"" for aetiology).

== Primary Venous Insufficiency ==

**Varicose Disease or Essential Varicose Veins or Primary Varicose Veins**  
Varicose veins are defined as veins with pathological walls that become dilated and tortuous, with valvular incontinence. This is the most common aetiology. There are two types of varicose veins:

- Systemic varicose veins, which develop at the expense of the greater and lesser saphenous veins.
- Non-systematic varicose veins, known as non-saphenous varicose veins, which develop at the expense of perforating veins or pelvic veins.

**Primary Deep Valve Insufficiency**  
Primary deep valve insufficiency results from a defect in valvular continence or valvular dysgenesis of the deep veins, leading to deep venous reflux. It is a rare condition.

== Secondary Venous Insufficiency ==

**Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS)**  
The risk is particularly high in cases of iliofemoral thrombosis. It is estimated that 20-50% of deep vein thromboses will become complicated by PTS despite well-managed treatment (5-10% will develop severe PTS).

**Compressive Venous Syndromes**  
Cockett's syndrome is due to compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. It can range from simple compression to thrombosis or complete left iliofemoral occlusion. Other chronic extrinsic venous compressions are mainly due to pelvic tumors. They are usually responsible for iliofemoral thrombosis.

== Functional Venous Insufficiency ==

This term is currently reserved for venous return failure with morphologically normal veins. This situation may be linked to a reduction in walking ability, tibio-tarsal ankylosis, a loss of muscle volume, or an alteration in cardio-respiratory dynamics. It is frequently encountered in the elderly.

== Other Causes of Venous Insufficiency ==

These represent only a very small proportion of the causes of venous insufficiency. These are simple or complex venous malformations. The most common malformative syndrome is Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome, which combines venous dysplasia, capillary malformation, and elongation/hypertrophy of the affected limb.

Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) of the lower limbs is a major public health problem. Its overall prevalence is estimated at between 30% and 60%, depending on the study, in industrialized countries, with a clear preponderance of women (male-female sex ratio = 1/3), although this tends to even out with age. In 2011 in France, around 20 million patients had a CVI and over 400,000 patients had a venous ulcer.

**Description:** Knowing the main clinical signs of chronic venous insufficiency  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

== Clinical Expression of Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) ==  
The symptoms of CVI are frequent, varied, and not very specific. The intensity of symptoms and physical signs vary according to the degree of venous stasis. They increase when circumstances aggravate venous stasis and decrease when it improves. Neglected, CVI can cause trophic disorders such as skin ulcers (SD-092). The symptoms are integrated into the CEAP classification of the IVC (""C"" for clinical).

== Functional Signs ==  

- Pain or heaviness in the lower limbs: This is the most frequent symptom of CVI. It occurs in the calves or legs and may be limited to simple discomfort or tiredness.
- Cramping
- Painful vein pathway or phlebalgia: Exacerbated pain in the pathway of a vein.
- Intermittent venous claudication related to chronic obstruction of a major venous confluence. This is a painful heaviness that does not prevent the patient from continuing to walk, does not subside rapidly when walking is stopped, and subsides progressively when the patient is in a decubitus position.

=== Evidence in Favour of a Venous Origin ===  
Increased symptoms in the following situations:  

- During the day
- After prolonged standing or sitting
- Heat (underfloor heating) or exposure to the sun
- During pregnancy, when taking oestroprogestins, or during the premenstrual period

Improvement of symptoms in the following situations:  

- Cold
- Elevation of the lower limbs
- Decubitus
- Physical exercise
- Elastic venous compression (socks, stockings, bands)

=== Differential Diagnoses ===  
Other symptoms, such as impatience, tingling, and skin redness, may be present but must be differentiated from two other less well-known diagnoses:

- Nocturnal impatience (imperious need to move the legs), which may be part of the ""restless legs syndrome"": The patient describes a sensation of numbness of the limb in a position of immobility, rapidly intolerable, forcing them to move.
- Burning and redness of the foot after a few hours' sleep, waking the patient and forcing them to seek contact with the cold, corresponding to erythermalgia (SD-015).

== Cutaneous Signs ==  
Trophic cutaneous signs linked to the development of venous insufficiency and varicose veins include:

- Varicosities or telangiectasias: Dilations of small-caliber veins (< 3 mm). When located on the ankle or plantar arch, they are known as corona phlebectatica and are a warning sign of the onset of a venous ulcer in the long term.
- Varicose veins
- Localized or diffuse oedema (SD-054) of the foot: It is white, soft, takes on a cup-like appearance, with a clear increase at night, without redistribution to other areas.
- Pigmented dermatitis: Caused by the passage of red blood cells into the dermis, releasing their iron pigments. Ochre dermatitis is irreversible and usually begins on the inside and lower side of the leg.
- Eczema of the lower third of the leg: A frequent complication of chronic venous stasis. The lesions are erythemato-vesicular or scaly in the pathological venous territory.
- Milian's white atrophy: Small porcelain-white areas, mainly located on the malleolus, surrounded by ochre dermatitis or telangiectasia. It reflects a rarefaction of capillaries within fibrous tissue, indicating genuine cutaneous ischaemia, heralding the onset of a venous ulcer.
- Stasis dermo-hypodermatitis (lipodermatosclerosis): Localized to the lower third of the leg, initially inflammatory with skin redness and pain, then progressing in flare-ups. These lesions are associated with extravasation of polymorphonuclear cells. Progressive evolution leads to sheathing fibrosis inducing a rigid gaiter (""sclerotic hypodermitis""). Ankylosis of the ankle further impairs venous return. The diagnosis of erysipelas is an important differential diagnosis of inflammatory stasis hypodermatitis.
- Lymphatic stasis: The consequence of advanced CVI, which alters the lymphatic network. It leads to permanent infiltrated oedema and thickened, cardboard-like skin. Lymphatic stasis is often aggravated by recurrent local superinfections.
- Venous ulcer (SD-092).

The diagnosis of Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) is based on questioning to identify functional signs, clinical examination, and the use of complementary examinations (SDD-SD-231).

Clinical signs are assessed with the patient in a standing position, using the phlebology stepladder technique. The lower limb is examined in external rotation and slightly flexed, particularly for the great saphenous vein. The examination must be bilateral and comparative.

**Inspection and Palpation of the Veins**

- Distinguish between varicose veins of the greater saphenous vein, lesser saphenous vein sectors, and non-systematised varicose veins.
- Palpation checks for pain and induration suggestive of superficial venous thrombosis.

In addition to the clinical examination, a venous Doppler ultrasound is performed in the standing position to confirm the diagnosis. It checks for reflux in the deep and superficial venous network.

**Title:** Principles of Therapeutic Management of CVI  
**Description:** Management of a Patient with CVI  
**Rubric:** Management  

== Definitions ==

**Lifestyle**  
Therapeutic lifestyle changes consist of encouraging venous return to reduce venous hyperpressure and apply to all stages of venous insufficiency and varicose veins:

- Raising the legs, raising the feet of the bed by 7-10 cm
- Combatting a sedentary lifestyle
- Walking regularly every day
- Avoiding crossing legs when sitting
- Avoiding prolonged standing
- Managing overweight and obesity
- Avoiding underfloor heating, hot baths, and prolonged sun exposure
- Managing constipation

**Elastic Compression**  
This involves applying pressure to a segment of the limb using elastic materials such as bands, socks, self-fastening stockings, or tights. The pressure decreases from the ankle to the thigh. It is most effective when applied in the morning, within an hour of getting up. Application may require devices or assistance.

There are four classes of elastic compression based on ankle pressure:  
- Class I: 10-15 mmHg  
- Class II: 15.1-20 mmHg  
- Class III: 20.1-36 mmHg  
- Class IV: >36 mmHg  

Functional CVI is an indication for class I compression, while lymphatic insufficiency requires class IV. Contraindications include obliterative arterial disease with SPI < 0.60, septic venous thrombosis, phlegmatia caerulae, and diabetic microangiopathy with TcPO2 < 30 mmHg. Regular reassessment of the benefit/risk ratio is essential in certain cases.

**Clinical Situations and Compression Devices**  
- Varicose veins > 3 mm: Class II or III socks, thigh-highs, pantyhose (Long-term use)  
- After sclerotherapy, heat treatment, or stripping: Class II or III lower thigh (4 to 6 weeks)  
- Chronic oedema of venous origin: Class III socks, thigh-highs, tights (Long-term, regular re-evaluation)  
- Pigmentation, eczema: Class III socks, thigh-highs, tights  
- Lipodermatosclerosis, venous hypodermatitis, white atrophy: Class III socks, thigh-highs, tights  
- Healed ulcer: Class III or IV socks, thigh-highs, tights  
- Open ulcer: Multi-type bandages as first-line treatment, Class III or IV socks, thigh-highs, tights (Until complete healing)

**Drug Treatment**  
Venotonic drugs are prescribed for functional symptoms like discomfort and heaviness in the legs, as an adjunct to a healthy lifestyle and elastic compression. They are prescribed for short periods.

**Sclerotherapy, Endovenous Thermal Techniques, and Surgery**  
These treatments are for symptomatic varicose veins and aim to ""destroy"" pathological veins. The patient's condition and cardiovascular risk factors must be considered. The choice of technique depends on the location, appearance, and diameter of the varicose veins.

**Sclerotherapy**  
Involves injecting a sclerosing agent into a varicose vein, possibly under ultrasound control. It is indicated from CEAP stage C2 upwards. Complications include haematoma and pigmentation sequelae. The benefit/risk balance must be assessed, and patients must be informed.

**Endovenous Thermal Techniques**  
These techniques (laser or radiofrequency) have replaced traditional surgery and are first-line when sclerotherapy is not indicated. They can be done without general anaesthesia and allow quick resumption of activities.

**Surgery**  
Indications for surgery are limited. Techniques include stripping and phlebectomy. Stripping is for extensive forms and requires anaesthesia and time off work. Phlebectomies involve removing superficial varicose veins under local anaesthetic.

Vascular nephropathies are a group of heterogeneous diseases characterized by damage to the renal vessels. Some diseases involve the large vessels (obstruction of the renal arteries), while others affect the small vessels (nephroangiosclerosis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and cholesterol crystal embolism diseases). Drug prescription, follow-up consultation, and education of a hypertensive patient (SD-282) are often at the forefront. It may be the cause or consequence of kidney disease. Vascular nephropathies can be classified according to their rate of progression and the location of renal arterial damage.

**Renal Infarction:**

- The presentation is severe and may include:
  - Back pain mimicking renal colic or abdominal pain
  - Macroscopic haematuria
  - Hypertensive flare-up
  - Anuria if the occlusion is bilateral or in a single kidney
  - Fever
- Biological indicators:
  - Elevation of LDH
  - Variable elevation of creatinine
  - Inflammatory syndrome
- Diagnosis is confirmed by spiral CT scan, MRI angiography, or arteriography.
- This is an emergency because revascularization (by intraluminal angioplasty or surgery) can only be performed in the first few hours following occlusion. Therapeutic alternatives include fibrinolytics and anticoagulants.

**Benign Nephroangiosclerosis:**

- Often a diagnosis of exclusion, based on several factors:
  - Background: cardiovascular history, cardiovascular risk factors, elderly subject
  - Long-standing hypertension, often poorly controlled, with repercussions (left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertensive retinopathy)
  - Slowly progressive chronic renal failure
  - Poor urinary syndrome:
    - No haematuria or leucocyturia
    - Proteinuria absent or moderate
  - Kidneys of normal or reduced size depending on the degree of renal failure, symmetrical in size, with harmonious contours and no renal artery stenosis

Haemorrhoidal disease refers to all complaints associated with changes in haemorrhoidal tissue. It is referred to as an ""attack"" when complaints are of short duration and include a painful component, or as a chronic disease when signs are regular. Symptoms are usually accompanied by a morphological change in the haemorrhoids, but there is no anatomo-clinical correlation (people can complain of small haemorrhoids, or have large haemorrhoids without feeling them). The pathogenesis of haemorrhoidal disease is only partially understood. There are two theories that lead to a normal, asymptomatic anatomical component becoming symptomatic: the mechanical theory and the vascular theory.

- **Mechanical Theory:** This theory is based on a weakening of the support tissue or anchoring material of the internal haemorrhoids. Long bowel movements, straining (dyschesia), changes in stool consistency (hard stools), and childbirth are risk factors for the onset of haemorrhoidal signs. Many patients express that the onset of signs of haemorrhoidal disease coincides with childbirth.

- **Vascular Theory:** This theory likens haemorrhoidal disease to venous insufficiency. However, haemorrhoids are not veins (they do not have congenital valves) and the red bleeding of a haemorrhoidal crisis is not venous. The increase in size of haemorrhoidal tissue at the end of pregnancy and the short-term effectiveness of so-called veinotonic treatments support this hypothesis.

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

Haemorrhoidal symptoms linked to the internal plexuses can be expressed in two ways: either noisily over a short period of time (haemorrhoidal crisis) or as long-lasting symptoms accentuated during and after defecation.

Haemorrhoidal crisis combines, to varying degrees, a sensation of burning, tension, or sharp pain in the anus, red defecatory bleeding (anal epistaxis) which can be significant but is not mixed with stool, and sensitive anal swelling or a perception of internal tension. Symptoms occur rapidly and last for a few days, often accentuated by defecation.

When the signs become chronic, they often include defecatory and post-defecatory anal burning that does not last long, more or less significant prolapse of the anus that is more or less reducible after defecation, and bleeding. These symptoms may develop periodically. Anal pruritus is a complaint often attributed to haemorrhoids, but the causal relationship is tenuous. It should not be considered a haemorrhoidal symptom, particularly if it is chronic. Instrumental or surgical treatment of haemorrhoids should not be proposed in cases of chronic anal pruritus.

The classification of haemorrhoidal tissue into grades is classic:

- Grade I: No prolapse in the anoscopic lumen.
- Grade II: Prolapse in the lumen of the anoscopy but not outside.
- Grade III: Prolapse outside the anus during pushing but spontaneous reintegration at the end of pushing.
- Grade IV: Permanent prolapse from the outset. In this situation, the internal haemorrhoids are visible outside the anus, and anoscopy is often not necessary to visualize them.

The important value of the clinical examination lies not only in describing the haemorrhoidal tissue but also in looking for associated lesions: anal fissure in the radiating folds (often at the posterior pole of the anus, the anal fissure is an inspection diagnosis), anal abscess or fistula, condyloma, marisci, cancer of the anal canal or rectum.",1.0,15.15571428571429,False,True,0.7195185422897339,0.6442364851633707,c,True,4,3,288,1302

== Definitions ==

### a) Hygienic Dietary Rules

Hygienic dietary rules are a major element in the therapeutic management of haemorrhoidal disease. Dietary exclusion diets are not effective. Generally speaking, dietary hygiene rules aim to combat chronic constipation. Treating chronic constipation is a common-sense measure aimed at limiting the onset of haemorrhoidal disease, preventing recurrences, and perhaps even complications. Dietary changes that help to correct stool consistency and regulate transit are recommended. Introducing a diet rich in soluble fiber (linseed, chia seeds, blond psyllium, etc.) and correcting constipation can reduce the time spent having a bowel movement and reduce dyschezia. This helps to resolve symptoms in the acute phase of haemorrhoidal attacks, prevent attacks, and treat chronic haemorrhoidal disease.

### b) Medication

**Treatment of Internal Haemorrhoidal Disease:**

Diosmin has proven efficacy in the treatment of haemorrhoidal attacks because it reduces the intensity and duration of symptoms. Local topicals include all emollient products for topical application (creams, ointments, and suppositories). They contain agents capable of reducing the inflammatory component of the haemorrhoidal crisis, acting on the oedematous component of the crisis, and promoting healing. Some topicals also have analgesic properties through local anaesthetics. Like the class of venotonics, these drugs are offered as short courses of treatment for haemorrhoidal attacks. They are not indicated in cases of chronic pathology, mainly dominated by bleeding or defecatory anal procidence.

**Treatment of External Haemorrhoidal Disease:**

The only manifestation of external haemorrhoids is external haemorrhoidal thrombosis, which is treated by incision or excision. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are an alternative to incision/excision. Short courses of corticosteroids are an alternative in cases where NSAIDs and surgical treatment are contraindicated, particularly where there is a strong oedematous component.

### c) Principles of Instrumental and Surgical Treatments

The term ""instrumental haemorrhoid treatment"" refers to all procedures carried out to constrain the haemorrhoidal anal procidence, reinforce the supporting tissue, and form a scar at the top of the haemorrhoid. These therapeutic methods are carried out on an outpatient basis, through an anoscopy, and most often during a specialised gastroenterology consultation. These strategies constitute the basic treatment for chronic haemorrhoidal disease. They should not be carried out during a flare-up of the disease and do not represent a preventive treatment for external haemorrhoidal thrombosis. Various techniques can be used to create a chemical (sclerosis), ischaemic (elastic ligation), or thermal (infrared, bipolar coagulation, cryotherapy) eschar. The treatment is applied in a sector, in the rectal mucosa (no thermoalgesic sensitivity) above (and not on top of) the internal haemorrhoidal tissue. These methods do not remove or sclerotise the haemorrhoidal tissue itself. When the indications are well-targeted, they provide significant benefit more than three times out of four. However, their effectiveness decreases with the length of follow-up. These methods may give rise to rare complications (bleeding following the fall of an eschar, infections). Elastic ligation offers the best risk/benefit ratio but is contraindicated in patients taking anticoagulants.

""Surgical haemorrhoid treatment"" describes all procedures designed to treat haemorrhoidal tissue under general, peridural, or locoregional anaesthetic. There are two types of haemorrhoidal surgery: those which remove the haemorrhoidal tissue (known as haemorrhoidectomy) and those which fix or tighten the haemorrhoidal tissue using a mechanical process (pexy with wire or mechanical forceps) or heat (radiofrequency, laser). The first type is the benchmark in terms of effectiveness and is often the only procedure possible in cases of anatomically advanced haemorrhoidal disease or recurrent external thrombosis. The second type is more similar to the instrumental treatments mentioned above: it is simpler, often quicker, and less painful. Patients are often immobilised for a shorter period after the procedure. There is a greater risk of recurrence. Complications are inherent in any type of surgery, but rare functional sequelae such as incontinence must be prevented and assessed before the procedure.

The treatment of external haemorrhoidal thrombosis is not, strictly speaking, a surgical procedure. However, an incision or excision can easily be performed in consultation. With a few precautions and a little patience, this strategy is effective in relieving pain and shortening its course. The alternative is to prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",0.6666666666666666,13.860000000000005,False,True,0.8015360832214355,0.6206251382827759,b,False,4,4,288,1307

Haemorrhoids in themselves present no risk of degeneration or life-threatening complications. Only symptomatic haemorrhoids should be treated. It is therefore the symptoms and the patient's request for treatment that should dictate the therapist's attitude. The four rules of the therapeutic preamble can therefore be stated as follows:

- Treatment of haemorrhoids should be reserved for symptomatic forms.
- In most cases, haemorrhoid treatment is a comfort treatment.

**Definitions**  
- Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two main causes of familial breast and ovarian cancer, classically known as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). The mode of transmission is autosomal recessive.
- HBOC accounts for around 20% of familial breast cancers, but less than 5% of all breast cancers. It is important to look for a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and, if necessary, to draw up a family tree.
- The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes code for proteins that play major roles in DNA repair and act as tumor suppressors. If these proteins are defective, DNA double-strand breaks are not repaired and contribute to carcinogenesis.
- A patient with a BRCA1/2 mutation should undergo either specific annual surveillance, including breast MRI, or prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. Prophylactic bilateral adnexectomy is systematically recommended (between the ages of 40 and 45).

**Additional Genetic Predispositions**

The Bi-Rad Classification is used to assess breast lesions. Lesions classified as Bi-rads 4 and 5 (imaging classification) must be biopsied, as must lesions classified as Bi-rads 3 in BRCA mutated patients or patients who are otherwise carriers of a malignant biopsied lesion.

These biopsies are carried out preoperatively, reducing the need for peroperative extemporaneous examination and making it possible to define a course of action with the patient before the operation.

Breast biopsies are performed in two ways: microbiopsies or macrobiopsies. Microbiopsies are usually performed under ultrasound guidance (ultrasound mass), and macrobiopsies are usually performed under stereotaxis (mammographic microcalcification focus). Macrobiopsies may also be performed under MRI when the lesion classified as Bi-rads 4 or 5 is not visible on mammography or ultrasound. The biopsy is used to confirm the histological diagnosis and assess a number of prognostic factors.

Cytology samples are not recommended for a mass or a focus of microcalcifications. However, cytology of a suspicious axillary adenopathy or of a nipple discharge in the case of a suspicious discharge (bloody) may be useful.

**Rubric:** Definition  

== Benign Tumours ==

The general characteristics of benign tumours include well-defined contours, slow growth, and local evolution limited to the breast.

=== Adenofibroma ===

Adenofibroma is a mixed epithelial and conjunctival proliferation occurring in young women (under 25-30 years), including adolescents. It presents as a swelling that is usually painless, well-limited, and mobile in relation to the skin and the rest of the mammary gland. It is generally less than 30 mm in size, with a firm (renitent) consistency, without any local signs or suspicious adenopathy.

=== Fibrocystic Mastopathy (FMK) ===

This is the most common benign breast disease in women aged between 35 and 50, which may persist after menopause in women taking HRT. It is revealed by the presence of mastodynia associated with menstrual cycles. Clinical examination reveals:

- A single or multiple, rounded, well-defined, mobile mass of variable consistency (usually soft), which may be tender or even painful (cyst under tension).
- Ambiguous, sensitive discharge, sometimes nipple discharge (whitish, greenish, thick).
- Absence of suspicious axillary adenopathy.

== Carcinoma ""In Situ"" ==

There are two types of ""in situ"" (non-invasive) carcinoma of the breast: ductal carcinoma ""in situ"" (also known as intracanal) and lobular carcinoma ""in situ"". The cells involved have no metastatic potential because they do not cross the basement membrane.

== Malignant Tumours ==

Anatomopathological analysis is used to confirm the diagnosis and assess prognostic and predictive factors. In the majority of cases, breast cancers are non-specific infiltrating adenocarcinomas (usually abbreviated to carcinomas), also known as infiltrating ductal carcinomas.

Anatomopathology will specify the following elements:

- Histological type (non-specific infiltrating carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carcinoma, etc.)
- Elston and Ellis grade (Scarff-Bloom and Richardson modified)
- Percentage of hormone receptor expression (oestrogen and progesterone)
- HER2 status
- Ki67 (reflects cell proliferation)

- Size (on surgical specimen only)
- Number of invaded axillary lymph nodes (on surgical specimen only)

**Title:** Knowing the Principles of Breast Cancer Extension Assessment  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Additional Examinations

**Definitions**

**Local Extension Assessment**

- Local extension assessment is based on mammography and ultrasound. It looks for additional lesions and axillary adenopathy.
- Apart from high-risk situations (BRCA 1 or 2 mutated patients), MRI is recommended in cases where the clinical, mammography, and ultrasound findings are inconsistent, or where it is difficult to assess tumour size or the number of lesions if conservative treatment is envisaged.

**Remote Extension Assessment**

- Preferred metastatic sites are bone, lung, liver, skin, distant adenopathy, and brain.
- Extension work-up to look for visceral or bone metastases is not systematic. It should not delay referral to a specialist centre, where a decision will be made if necessary (according to INCa recommendations, June 2020).
- Axillary exploration is carried out by analysis of the sentinel lymph node (1 to 4 lymph nodes) ""in the absence of lymph node invasion"" (clinical or histological) and ""breast lesion less than 5 cm"" preoperatively. If this is not the case (proven lymph node invasion or breast lesion of more than 5 cm), an axillary curage (removal of all the axillary lymph nodes) will be carried out intraoperatively. The sentinel lymph node technique significantly reduces the risk of complications associated with lymph node dissection (lymphoedema).
- An extension assessment is carried out when there are negative prognostic factors. For example, it should always be carried out in the case of lymph node invasion (clinical or histological) or a pre-operative lesion larger than 5 cm.
- In this case, the first intention work-up is based on one of the following two options:

**Title:** Knowing the Objectives and Principles of Breast Cancer Treatment  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Management  

== Objectives ==  
In localized stages, treatment is curative and always includes breast surgery and surgery of the homolateral axillary lymph nodes. Depending on various prognostic/predictive factors and the type of surgery, chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy and/or treatment with trastuzumab (anti-HER2 antibody) and/or radiotherapy may be carried out in the (neo)adjuvant setting.

In metastatic stages, treatment cannot be curative and is essentially based on systemic treatments (chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapies). The aim of these treatments is to increase patients' survival and improve their quality of life.

== Treatment Principles ==  
Don't forget the associated measures:

- Discussion of the therapeutic strategy at a multidisciplinary consultation meeting (RCP) to define the optimal treatment for the patient.
- Announcement consultation, explanation of the personalized care plan (PPS).
- Application for exemption from co-payment (ALD 30).
- Comprehensive care, including psychological, social, and dietary support.
- Supportive care deals with the consequences of the disease and its treatment, and can include pain management, nutrition, fatigue, fertility/sexuality, adapted physical activity sessions, art therapy, socio-aesthetic advice, etc.

=== 1. Surgery ===  
Breast treatment may be conservative or radical, depending on the size of the tumor, the number of sites, the volume of the breast, and any associated lesions (carcinoma in situ).

Surgery of the armpit is always associated with invasive carcinoma. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to drain the mammary gland: its anatomopathological analysis, when negative, makes it possible to dispense with the more morbid lymph node dissection; it involves double identification by injection of technetium and patent blue or by fluorescence using indocyanine green. If the lymph node is invaded preoperatively (positive puncture under ultrasound), axillary lymph node dissection is carried out immediately.

=== 2. Radiotherapy ===  
Breast radiotherapy combines external radiotherapy of the whole breast and additional radiation in the operating bed (""boost""). It is used systematically after conservative surgery.

Parietal radiotherapy (after mastectomy) combined with an additional dose in the operating bed is indicated in the presence of several poor prognostic factors.

Radiotherapy of the lymph nodes is justified in the case of axillary lymph node involvement (supra-clavicular fossa +/- internal mammary chain).

=== 3. Systemic Treatments ===  
In the localized stages of the disease, systemic treatments are either ""adjuvant"" (after surgery) or ""neoadjuvant"" (before surgery). The aim of (neo)adjuvant treatment is to destroy distant micro-metastases that are not detected by the extension work-up, thereby reducing the risk of relapse, particularly in the form of metastases.

In the metastatic stage, treatments are given throughout the course of the disease (except in the final palliative phase) and are adapted to the course of the disease and the patient's tolerance.

- **Chemotherapy:** The two main families used are anthracyclines and taxanes. Adverse reactions are detailed in item 294.
- **Hormone Therapy:** Either anti-oestrogen (tamoxifen) or anti-aromatase (letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane). The main hormonal effects are hot flushes, weight gain, arthralgia, thrombosis, and increased risk of endometrial cancer (tamoxifen) and osteoporosis (anti-aromatase).
- **Targeted Therapies:** A large number of targeted therapies are used in oncology. The main class that has made it possible to change the natural history of breast cancer by increasing the cure rate of certain cancers is the anti-HER2 class. The leader is trastuzumab.

=== 4. Monitoring ===  
It includes:

- Joint management by: surgeon, medical oncologist, radiotherapist, general practitioner, gynecologist, etc.
- A clinical breast examination at least twice a year for the first 5 years, then annually.
- A mammogram and ultrasound are carried out every year for life.
- Other examinations are carried out on request.

=== 5. Support Care ===  
This is systematic and helps to maintain quality of life. In the case of bone metastases, it is essential to prescribe a bisphosphonate or denosumab to limit bone complications. Deconditioning during exercise is often identified and may be the subject of a medical prescription for adapted physical activity.",1.0,9.92666666666667,False,True,0.7392159104347229,0.6283780733744303,b,False,5,2,312,1350
